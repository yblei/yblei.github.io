I am a PhD student in the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics lab](utn.de/departments/department-engineering/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics-lab/) at [University of Technology Nuremberg](utn.de), headed by Prof. Wolfram Burgard. 
My research is focused on the intersection of mobile robotics and AI. 
As a great team, we leverage the power of modern foundation models to create the next generation of smart machines.
