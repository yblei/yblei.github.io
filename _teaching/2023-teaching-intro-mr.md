This course introduced basic concepts and techniques used within the field of 
mobile robotics. The course focused on the fundamental challenges for autonomous 
intelligent systems and presented the state-of-the-art solutions. The course 
focus lied on probabilistic approaches to robot state estimation. Among other 
topics, we discussed:
* Kinematics
* Sensors
* Probabilistic modelling
* Robot localization
* Mapping
* SLAM
* Path Planning
* Ethics in Robotics
