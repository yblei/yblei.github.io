collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-09-01-ma_loss
excerpt: 'Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are nowadays often employed in vision-based perception stacks for safetycritical applications such as autonomous driving or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Due to the safety requirements in those use cases, it is important to know the limitations of the CNN and, thus, to detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. In this work, we present an approach to enable OOD detection for 2D object detection by employing the margin entropy (ME) loss.'
