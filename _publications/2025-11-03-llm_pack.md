title: "LLM-Pack: Intuitive Grocery Handling for Logistics Applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-11-03-llm_pack
excerpt: 'Robotics and automation are increasingly influential in logistics but remain largely confined to traditional
warehouses. In grocery retail, advancements such as cashier-less
supermarkets exist, yet customers still manually pick and pack
groceries. While there has been a substantial focus in robotics
on the bin picking problem, the task of packing objects and
groceries has remained largely untouched. However, packing
grocery items in the right order is crucial for preventing
product damage, e.g., heavy objects should not be placed on
top of fragile ones. However, the exact criteria for the right
packing order are hard to define, in particular given the huge
variety of objects typically found in stores. In this paper, we
introduce LLM-Pack, a novel approach for grocery packing.
LLM-Pack leverages language and vision foundation models
for identifying groceries and generating a packing sequence
that mimics human packing strategy. LLM-Pack does not
require dedicated training to handle new grocery items and its
modularity allows easy upgrades of the underlying foundation
models. We extensively evaluate our approach to demonstrate
its performance. We will make the source code of LLMPack publicly available upon the publication of this manuscript.'
